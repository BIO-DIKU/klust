## Installation

### Compiling source

Klust compiles with C++11 support but has no dependencies on other external
libraries. To get the source and make the project binary type the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/BIO-DIKU/klust.git
$ cd klust
$ cmake .
$ make
```

After running `make`, the executable will be in the root directory named BIO-DIKU-klust.
